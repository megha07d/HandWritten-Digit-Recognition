# Handwritten Digit Recognition using Deep Learning
A deep learning based project to recognize handwritten digits using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to build a model that can accurately identify digits from hand-written images. The model is built using the popular deep learning framework, [Keras](https://keras.io/) and [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) as the backend. The model is trained on the MNIST dataset, which contains 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images of handwritten digits.

## Features
- Implementing Keras sequential layers architecture for image classification
- Training the model on the MNIST dataset
- Testing the model's accuracy on the test dataset

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Keras
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

## Usage
1. Clone the repository

2. Install the required libraries

3. Run the Jupyter Notebook
